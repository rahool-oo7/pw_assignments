        "15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "  - Causation means when one variable directly causes a effect or change is another variable. Difference is that correlation means two things moving together like Increase in Ice cream sale and decrease in Heater sale in summer. Whereas caustion means one thing causes an effect to another like switching on a switch causes the the bulb to turn on.\n",
